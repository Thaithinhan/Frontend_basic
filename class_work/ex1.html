        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web
        pages, but how does it work under the hood?
      </p>
      <p id="p2">
        With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing
        between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what
        background images or background colors are to be used, different
        displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
      </p>
      <p id="p3">
        <b> Tip:</b> The word <b>cascading </b> means that a style applied to a
        parent element will also apply to all children elements within the
        parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all
        headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also
        get the same color (unless you specify something else)!
